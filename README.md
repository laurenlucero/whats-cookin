# What's Cookin'?

In this partner project, we pair programmed a recipe tracking / meal planning application that allows users to view their favorite recipes and plan shopping trips around them. Users can view a recipes, favorite recipes and choose recipes to cook.
We followed project specifications to make a working application and implemented ES6 classes that communicate to each other as needed. We wrote modular, reusable code that follows SRP and implemented a robust testing suite using TDD. We used prototype methods to perform data manipulation and created a clear, easy to use interface.

To view this application, fork and clone this repo.

## MVP & Future Iterations
In this iteration of the application, users can view recipes, favorite recipes and choose recipes to cook.
Future iterations would allow users to filter favorites and recipes to cook, as well as search recipes by name, ingredient or tag. Users would also be able to compare ingredients in their pantry to ingredients in a recipe then get a shopping list of amounts and estimated cost.
